# `json-parser`

JSON (which stands for JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format, which is widely used for transmitting data over the Internet. It is formally defined by the [RFC 4627](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4627) or thereâ€™s a simpler graphical representation [here](https://www.json.org/json-en.html)

## Overview
In this project, I will build a custom JSON parser.

## Development
This json-parser will be initially developed by `Python` and then by `C` later
