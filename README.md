JSON (which stands for JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format, which is widely used for transmitting data over the Internet. It is formally defined by the IETF [here](https://tools.ietf.org/html/std90) or thereâ€™s a simpler graphical representation [here](https://www.json.org/json-en.html)
